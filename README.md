# HubTitleJoin

Hub Title Join plugin is a plugin for hub servers. This basically replaces the command block method of displaying a title message to users when stepped on pressure plate. I found that it took up your whole screen and you can barley read it. So me and my friend developed this plugin that will fit the "title message" on your screen and in the chat. This is fully customize-able and you can put what you want in the configuration.
